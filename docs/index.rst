**********************************
Welcome to radial's documentation!
**********************************

``radial`` is a tool to work with the radial velocities of stars that have objects orbiting them, such as planets or stellar companions. The code is completely object-oriented and designed to be used with Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. If you find any bugs or have questions and suggestions about the code or the documentation, feel free to submit an `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/RogueAstro/radial/issues>`_. ``radial`` is fully compatible with Python 3, and may have incompatibility issues with Python 2.
