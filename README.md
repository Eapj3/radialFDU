Starting to write a code for estimating radial velocities of stars with a massive companion.

Features
-----------

* Calculates the radial velocities of a star given a set of parameters

Issues
-----------

* The radial velocities will be mirrored depending on which half of the arccos you shift. I arbitrarily chose the code to shift the second half.
